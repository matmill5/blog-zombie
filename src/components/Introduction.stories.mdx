# Welcome to Blog Zombie!

This is the storybook for the Blog Zombie project.

We use this space to design, document, share, and develop the BlogPage and BlogPreviewTile Components.

You can browse example stories by navigating to them in the sidebar.

You can view code in the `src/stories` directory to learn how they work.

Blog Zombie subscribes to the idea of designing UIs with [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process and [**atomic design**](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) principles.
